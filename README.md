# Example Enemy

This repository contains the full source code for the Example Enemy for Lethal Company, including the Unity project which can be used to build its asset bundle.

### Setting Up The Project For Development

After copying this repo for yourself, run [SETUP-PROJECT.py](/SETUP-PROJECT.py) (make sure you have Python installed) to copy all the DLL files from the game files that the C# project and the Unity project depend on. However, make sure you have https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/HookGenPatcher/ installed and ran the game at least once with it so it can generate a few files. That should be all the required setup for this project, and now you can move to coding AI or making your own 3D models for your custom enemy. Good luck!
